Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, working in the Advanced Power Systems and Controls Lab. My research focuses on developing robust data-driven control algorithms and safe reinforcement learning methods for complex dynamical systems, with applications in energy systems and advanced manufacturing.

## Research Interests

My research bridges the gap between advanced control theory and practical industrial applications. I specialize in:

- **Data-Driven Control**: Developing reinforcement learning and data-driven predictive control frameworks that guarantee safety and robustness under uncertainty
- **Energy Systems**: Building multi-physics models for PEM fuel cells with degradation forecasting and lifetime-aware operation strategies
- **Advanced Manufacturing**: Optimizing roll-to-roll manufacturing processes through physics-based modeling and real-time control

## Current Research

I am currently working on several exciting projects:

### Learning-Based Control
- Developing safe reinforcement learning algorithms with quadratic-program safety filters
- Creating distributionally robust data-driven predictive control methods that combine physics-based and data-driven predictions
- Implementing trajectory valuation and influence-function methods for data attribution in control systems

### PEM Fuel Cell Systems
- Building comprehensive multi-physics PEMFC models with catalyst-layer degradation
- Designing curriculum-based RL with physics-informed rewards and safety shielding
- Applying Gaussian processes for degradation forecasting and lifetime-aware operation

### Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing
- Developing physics-based models of PET–EVA–PET lamination adhesion
- Implementing dual-roller heating systems that reduced EVA heating time by 62.6%
- Applying reinforcement learning for real-time PID auto-tuning of tension control
