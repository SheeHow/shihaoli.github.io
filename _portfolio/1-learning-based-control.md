- Combined physics-based and data-driven predictions for improved robustness
- Developed trajectory valuation and influence-function methods for data attribution

### Implementation
- **Languages**: Python (NumPy, PyTorch), MATLAB/Simulink
- **Methods**: Model Predictive Control, DeePC, System Identification
- **Applications**: Energy systems, manufacturing processes
