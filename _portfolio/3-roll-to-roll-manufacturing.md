## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing processes through physics-based modeling and intelligent control systems. The work specifically addresses PET–EVA–PET lamination processes used in flexible electronics and solar panel manufacturing.

## Technical Innovations

### Adhesion Dynamics Modeling
- Developed physics-based models using Hertzian contact mechanics
- Implemented transient heat transfer analysis for lamination processes
- Validated models through extensive peeling-force experiments

### Process Optimization
- **62.6% Reduction in Heating Time**: Implemented dual-roller heating system
- Increased throughput while maintaining product quality
- Reduced energy consumption through optimized temperature profiles

### Intelligent Control Systems
- Applied reinforcement learning for real-time PID auto-tuning
- Integrated LabVIEW for hardware control and data acquisition
- Achieved stable operation at elevated web speeds (>10 m/min)

## Experimental Setup

- Custom R2R lamination system with dual heating zones
- Force sensors for tension monitoring
- Thermal imaging for temperature profile analysis
- High-speed cameras for web tracking

## Key Results

1. **Manufacturing Efficiency**: 62.6% reduction in EVA heating time
2. **Quality Control**: <2% variation in adhesion strength across web width
3. **Energy Savings**: 40% reduction in energy consumption per unit area
4. **Throughput**: 50% increase in production speed
